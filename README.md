# inkheart

Formerly known as microme, inkheart is a full-text search engine that operates over an index of all my #playtime notes: my stray thoughts, random ideas, and project inklings. It automatically updates trihourly from my Macbook Air, and even maintains a note history: which allows me to update

Some important features I'm planning to implement / have implemented are:
- [x] tokenizer
- [x] lemmatizer
- [x] stop word removal
    - [] dynamically updating the stop word list with a td-idf
- [x] debouncer
- [] date and time analysis
- [] deep search
- [] bloom filters
- [] *sharding, parallelization, partitioning?*
- [] recommendation system

and more. (This list is *will* change over time).
